% Digital Twin development and deployment for Wind Turbine

% Step 1: Data Acquisition - Collect historical data from sensors mounted on
% the wind turbine
% Generate synthetic wind speed data
numSamples = 1000;
windSpeed = 10 + 5 * randn(numSamples,1); % Mean: 10 m/s, Standarad Deviation: 5 m/s

% Step 2: Modelling - Build a model of the wind turbine based on its physical
% characteristics
bladeLength = 50; % meters
turbineHeight = 80; % meters

% Step 3: Simulation - Simulate the behaviour of the wind turbine using the
% generated data and model
% Calculate power output based on wind speed
powerOutput = calculatePowerOutput(windSpeed, bladeLength);

% Step 4: Analysis - Analyze the simulated data to gain insights and
% identify potential issues
% Plot power output vs Wind Speed
figure;
plot(windSpeed, powerOutput, '.');
xlabel("Wind Speed (m/s)");
ylabel("Power Output (kW)");
title("Power Output vs. Wind Speed");

% Step 5: Deployment - Deploy the digital twin for real-time monitoring and
% control of the wind turbine
% For deployment, integrate the developed model and analysis alogrithm into
% the wind turbine's control system
% Function to calculate the power output based on wind speed
function powerOutput = calculatePowerOutput(windSpeed, bladeLength)
    % Simple power curve model
    ratedPower = 2000; % kW
    cutInWindSpeed = 3; % m/s
    cutOutWindSpeed = 25; % m/s

    % Calculate power output based on wind speed
    powerOutput = zeros(size(windSpeed));
    validIndices = windSpeed >= cutInWindSpeed & windSpeed <= cutOutWindSpeed;
    powerOutput(validIndices) = 0.5 * 1.225 * pi * bladeLength^2 * windSpeed(validIndices).^3 * 1e-3; % Power output in kW
    powerOutput(powerOutput > ratedPower) = ratedPower; % Apply rated power limit
